## Executive summary

This report represents the results of the engagement with **Opyn** to review **Perp Vault Templates**.

The review was conducted over the course of **1 week** from **26th to 30th of July, 2021**. A total of **10 person-days** were spent reviewing the code.


## Scope

The initial review focused on the [Perp Vault Templates](https://github.com/opynfinance/perp-vault-templates) repository, identified by the commit hash `1248e6606feb3279a94104df6c6dfcb8d46271f4`.

We focused on manually reviewing the codebase, searching for security issues such as, but not limited to, re-entrancy problems, transaction ordering, block timestamp dependency, exception handling, call stack depth limitation, integer overflow/underflow, self-destructible contracts, unsecured balance, use of origin, costly gas patterns, architectural problems, code readability.

**Includes:**

- code/contracts/core/OpynPerpVault.sol
- code/contracts/example-actions/ShortOToken.sol
- code/contracts/example-actions/ShortPutWithETH.sol
- code/contracts/utils/AuctionUtils.sol
- code/contracts/utils/CompoundUtils.sol
- code/contracts/utils/GammaUtils.sol
- code/contracts/utils/ZeroXUtils.sol
- code/contracts/utils/RollOverBase.sol
- code/contracts/utils/AirswapUtils.sol

## Recommendations

We identified a few possible general improvements that are not security issues during the review, which will bring value to the developers and the community reviewing and using the product.

### Remove upgradability

Upgradability is a feature that allows a developer to upgrade a contract to a new version without having to redeploy the entire codebase. This also means that the storage is usually handled differently if the contract is upgradeable. It creates more risk when organizing the storage, and more care needs to be put into the design of the storage. Additionally, it poses a risk when upgrading the contract to mess up the storage layout. Because the reviewed system is a template of what developers can do to leverage the Opyn protocol, we believe the added complexity of having upgradability is not worth it.

### Simplify overall architecture

The purpose of this system is to create a simple example that allows devs to understand how to leverage the Opyn protocol. A few methods have deep call stacks, and this doesn't help new developers trying to understand how to use the protocol.

Check the linked [call graph](#call-graph) to see how the methods are called. The deep call stack is a good indicator of a method that needs to be refactored. In some cases, an internal method has only one caller method, and we recommend removing some of them and adding the code directly in the caller body's method.

This will help with readability, reduce internal calls and reduce gas costs.

### Make the interaction with Actions more explicit and less reliant on actions reverting

Anyone can call `closePositions()` to finalize a round. 


[code/contracts/core/OpynPerpVault.sol#L310-L320](https://github.com/monoceros-alpha/review-opyn-perp-vault-templates-2021-07/blob/3d44603300dd9abffe5a1c1e1c2647e9f6b80c7b/code/contracts/core/OpynPerpVault.sol#L310-L320)
```solidity
  /**
   * @notice allows anyone to close out the previous round by calling "closePositions" on all actions.
   * @dev this does the following:
   * 1. calls closePositions on all the actions withdraw the money from all the actions
   * 2. pay all the fees
   * 3. snapshots last round's shares and asset balances
   * 4. empties the pendingDeposits and pulls in those assets to be used in the next round
   * 5. sets aside assets from the main vault into the withdrawQueue
   * 6. ends the old round and unlocks the vault
   */
  function closePositions() public onlyLocked unlockState {
```

When called, the first thing that happens is to call the internal function `_closeAndWithdraw()`.


[code/contracts/core/OpynPerpVault.sol#L321-L322](https://github.com/monoceros-alpha/review-opyn-perp-vault-templates-2021-07/blob/3d44603300dd9abffe5a1c1e1c2647e9f6b80c7b/code/contracts/core/OpynPerpVault.sol#L321-L322)
```solidity
    // calls closePositions on all the actions and transfers the assets back into the vault
    _closeAndWithdraw();
```

The internal method `_closeAndWithdraw()` goes through every action and tries to close each position.


[code/contracts/core/OpynPerpVault.sol#L419-L422](https://github.com/monoceros-alpha/review-opyn-perp-vault-templates-2021-07/blob/3d44603300dd9abffe5a1c1e1c2647e9f6b80c7b/code/contracts/core/OpynPerpVault.sol#L419-L422)
```solidity
  function _closeAndWithdraw() internal {
    for (uint8 i = 0; i < actions.length; i = i + 1) {
      // 1. close position. this should revert if any position is not ready to be closed.
      IAction(actions[i]).closePosition();
```

It expects a revert if the position cannot be closed. This makes the `OpynPerpVault` reliant on the correct implementation of all the actions and their 3rd part systems. If one of the actions was implemented incorrectly or the platform it relies on unexpectedly fails, all of the funds (from all of the actions) are blocked. It is desired to reduce the risk of this happening. 

An approach that strengthens the system as a whole is to allow actions to fail but require them to return `true` if the position can be closed and `false` if the position cannot be closed. This would allow the `OpynPerpVault` to be more independent of the actions. In addition, ideally, when an action fails, the `OpynPerpVault` will have the option of ignoring the action altogether instead of blocking all of the funds. 

This can be achieved by doing an external call and handling the returned values.

An example inspired by [OpenZeppelin's `SafeERC20.safeTransfer`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/566a774222707e424896c0c390a84dc3c13bdcb2/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol#L25) describes such an approach below.

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.7.2;

contract UnreliableContract {
    function run(uint n) public pure returns (bool) {
        if (n % 2 == 0) {
            revert("I dislike even numbers");
        }
        
        return true;
    }
}

contract CallExternal {
    event CallResult(bool success, bytes result);
    
    UnreliableContract immutable uc;
    
    constructor() {
        uc = new UnreliableContract();
    }
    
    function callExternal() public {
        // Instead of calling directly like so
        // uc.run(block.number);
        
        // You can use a low level call and handle the failed execution
        
        // Concatenates arguments in a Solidity style
        bytes memory callData = abi.encodeWithSelector(uc.run.selector, block.number);
        
        // Does an external call and returns the result.
        // This type of call does not fail if the external call fails
        (bool success, bytes memory result) = address(uc).call(callData);
        
        // `success` represents if the call failed or not (reverted or not)
        if (success) {
            emit CallResult(true, result);
        } else {
            // `result` has 2 parts:
            // `0x08c379a0` represents the error signature, specifically the first 4 bytes of `keccak256("Error(string)")`
            // The actual abi encoded string "I dislike even numbers"
            emit CallResult(false, result);
        }
    }
}
```

The first contract `UnreliableContract` reverts if even numbers are provided in the `run()` method. The second contract `CallExternal` calls the `run()` method of `UnreliableContract` and handles the failed execution.

A suggestion is to use a similar approach as the one described in the `CallExternal` contract. This would allow the `OpynPerpVault` to be more independent of the actions. All interactions with the actions could (but not necessarily) be considered untrustworthy, and the `OpynPerpVault` should be able to handle the failure of the actions.

### Consider removing storage changes in modifiers

There are 2 cases where modifiers that change state are used.


[code/contracts/core/OpynPerpVault.sol#L310-L320](https://github.com/monoceros-alpha/review-opyn-perp-vault-templates-2021-07/blob/3d44603300dd9abffe5a1c1e1c2647e9f6b80c7b/code/contracts/core/OpynPerpVault.sol#L310-L320)
```solidity
  /**
   * @notice allows anyone to close out the previous round by calling "closePositions" on all actions.
   * @dev this does the following:
   * 1. calls closePositions on all the actions withdraw the money from all the actions
   * 2. pay all the fees
   * 3. snapshots last round's shares and asset balances
   * 4. empties the pendingDeposits and pulls in those assets to be used in the next round
   * 5. sets aside assets from the main vault into the withdrawQueue
   * 6. ends the old round and unlocks the vault
   */
  function closePositions() public onlyLocked unlockState {
```


[code/contracts/core/OpynPerpVault.sol#L333-L336](https://github.com/monoceros-alpha/review-opyn-perp-vault-templates-2021-07/blob/3d44603300dd9abffe5a1c1e1c2647e9f6b80c7b/code/contracts/core/OpynPerpVault.sol#L333-L336)
```solidity
  /**
   * @notice distributes funds to each action and locks the vault
   */
  function rollOver(uint256[] calldata _allocationPercentages) external virtual onlyOwner onlyUnlocked lockState {
```

Usually modifiers are used to limit access (think about `onlyOwner`) and don't change state or emit events. We believe this pattern (of limiting access) is desired because it is more explicit and less error-prone. It also doesn't hide state-changing code within the modifier.

Changing state or having complex logic in the modifier is not incorrect, but it does reduce readability. The amount of generated code is still the same, the modifier's code is effectively "copied" in the contract's bytecode; adding the code from the modifiers (`lockState` and `unlockState`) will not increase/decrease the size of the contract, but it will increase readability.

### Use the Checks-Effects-Interactions Pattern

The [Checks-Effects-Interactions Pattern](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/develop/security-considerations.html#use-the-checks-effects-interactions-pattern) is a defensive security practice whereby calls to other (external or internal) contracts should be made only after the required checks have been made and any state changes performed.

Note that calls to known contracts might in turn cause calls to unknown contracts, so it is better to just apply this pattern.

We found that the Opyn Perp Vault Templates, follows this recommendation well, apart from the  `_snapshotShareAndAsset` where a call to the `_mint` function is performed before a state change:


[code/contracts/core/OpynPerpVault.sol#L565-L568](https://github.com/monoceros-alpha/review-opyn-perp-vault-templates-2021-07/blob/d94fcb2e2173008272604705a9fc618710349462/code/contracts/core/OpynPerpVault.sol#L565-L568)
```solidity
    uint256 sharesToMint = pendingDeposit.mul(totalShares).div(vaultBalance);
    _mint(address(this), sharesToMint);
    pendingDeposit = 0;
  }
```

In this case, this is not a security issue since `_mint` is part of the `ERC20` contract owned by the system. Nonetheless, our recommendation is to perform the `pendingDeposit` value reset before the call to the `mint` function.

### Increase the number of tests

A good rule of thumb is to have 100% test coverage. This does not guarantee the lack of security problems, but it means that the desired functionality behaves as intended. The negative tests also bring a lot of value because not allowing some actions to happen is part of the desired behavior.

## Issues


### [Registering a deposit uses the incorrect initial value for the user](https://github.com/monoceros-alpha/review-opyn-perp-vault-templates-2021-07/issues/9)
![Issue status: Open](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Status&message=Open&color=5856D6&style=flat-square) ![Major](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Severity&message=Major&color=ff3b30&style=flat-square)

**Description**

When the vault is locked, the users can still queue deposits and withdraws. However, they cannot be immediately accessed, so specific accounting needs to be done.

Users call `registerDeposit`:


[code/contracts/core/OpynPerpVault.sol#L245](https://github.com/monoceros-alpha/review-opyn-perp-vault-templates-2021-07/blob/3d44603300dd9abffe5a1c1e1c2647e9f6b80c7b/code/contracts/core/OpynPerpVault.sol#L245)
```solidity
  function registerDeposit(uint256 _amount, address _shareRecipient) external onlyLocked {
```

The funds they wish to deposit are moved into the vault.


[code/contracts/core/OpynPerpVault.sol#L246](https://github.com/monoceros-alpha/review-opyn-perp-vault-templates-2021-07/blob/3d44603300dd9abffe5a1c1e1c2647e9f6b80c7b/code/contracts/core/OpynPerpVault.sol#L246)
```solidity
    IERC20(asset).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);
```

And the accounting needs to be done for this user, to be handled later.


[code/contracts/core/OpynPerpVault.sol#L249-L251](https://github.com/monoceros-alpha/review-opyn-perp-vault-templates-2021-07/blob/3d44603300dd9abffe5a1c1e1c2647e9f6b80c7b/code/contracts/core/OpynPerpVault.sol#L249-L251)
```solidity
    userRoundQueuedDepositAmount[_shareRecipient][round] = userRoundQueuedWithdrawShares[_shareRecipient][round].add(
      _amount
    );
```

On top of the initial value of `userRoundQueuedDepositAmount[_shareRecipient][round]` we need to add the current deposited value of `_amount`.

However, a copy/paste artifact from `registerWithdraw` was left in the code, the initial value used is `userRoundQueuedWithdrawShares[_shareRecipient][round]` instead of `userRoundQueuedDepositAmount[_shareRecipient][round]`.

**Recommendation**

Update the accounting to reflect the correct initial value of the queued deposit.

### [A Vault owner can allocate 100% to one action](https://github.com/monoceros-alpha/review-opyn-perp-vault-templates-2021-07/issues/10)
![Issue status: Open](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Status&message=Open&color=5856D6&style=flat-square) ![Medium](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Severity&message=Medium&color=FF9500&style=flat-square)

**Description**

A Vault owner can call `rollOver` function in order to distribute the funds to the actions. The `_allocationPercentages` argument deals with how much each action should have allocated as a percentage of the available funds in the Vault:


[code/contracts/core/OpynPerpVault.sol#L336-L341](https://github.com/monoceros-alpha/review-opyn-perp-vault-templates-2021-07/blob/d94fcb2e2173008272604705a9fc618710349462/code/contracts/core/OpynPerpVault.sol#L336-L341)
```solidity
  function rollOver(uint256[] calldata _allocationPercentages) external virtual onlyOwner onlyUnlocked lockState {
    require(_allocationPercentages.length == actions.length, "INVALID_INPUT");

    emit Rollover(_allocationPercentages);

    _distribute(_allocationPercentages);
```

The `_distribute` function is responsible for ensuring that each action has allocated its respective share of funds: 


[code/contracts/core/OpynPerpVault.sol#L434-L443](https://github.com/monoceros-alpha/review-opyn-perp-vault-templates-2021-07/blob/d94fcb2e2173008272604705a9fc618710349462/code/contracts/core/OpynPerpVault.sol#L434-L443)
```solidity
  function _distribute(uint256[] memory _percentages) internal nonReentrant {
    uint256 totalBalance = _effectiveBalance();

    currentRoundStartingAmount = totalBalance;

    // keep track of total percentage to make sure we're summing up to 100%
    uint256 sumPercentage;
    for (uint8 i = 0; i < actions.length; i = i + 1) {
      sumPercentage = sumPercentage.add(_percentages[i]);
      require(sumPercentage <= BASE, "PERCENTAGE_SUM_EXCEED_MAX");
```

The issue is that there is no restriction about a maximum or minimum percentage allocation per action. This means that an owner can allocate 100% to only one action, irrespective of how many actions have been defined in the Vault.

This makes a Vault less transparent for its potential users since ultimately the owner can decide to allocate all the funds to only one (highly risky) action.

**Recommendation**

In order to reduce the amount of trust that a user needs to place in a Vault owner, a `minActionAllocationPercentage` parameter should be added to the contract. It can be specified in the `init` function, along with the other Vault parameters.  Once set this action should not be allowed to change (ie. no setter function).

The `minActionAllocationPercentage` parameter will specify a minimum allocation percentage for each action in the Vault. It will make the behavior of the system more predictable and transparent to its users. Even if set to 0 by the owner, its presence ensures that users know what they are signing up to when depositing assets into the vault.

NB: care should be taken to ensure correct validation of its value during the `init` stage. For example, having a 34% value for this parameter for a Vault with 3 actions would render the contract unable to allocate funds during `rollOver` stage.

### [`withdrawFromQueue` emits the wrong number of tokens withdrawn](https://github.com/monoceros-alpha/review-opyn-perp-vault-templates-2021-07/issues/7)
![Issue status: Open](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Status&message=Open&color=5856D6&style=flat-square) ![Medium](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Severity&message=Medium&color=FF9500&style=flat-square)

**Description**

`withdrawFromQueue` can be called by anyone in order to withdraw deposited tokens from a round:


[code/contracts/core/OpynPerpVault.sol#L305-L306](https://github.com/monoceros-alpha/review-opyn-perp-vault-templates-2021-07/blob/d94fcb2e2173008272604705a9fc618710349462/code/contracts/core/OpynPerpVault.sol#L305-L306)
```solidity
  function withdrawFromQueue(uint256 _round) external nonReentrant notEmergency {
    uint256 withdrawAmount = _withdrawFromQueue(_round);
```

The emitted event is _incorrectly_ using the `withdrawQueueAmount` variable which holds the tokens leftover in the queue to be withdrawn:


[code/contracts/core/OpynPerpVault.sol#L464-L471](https://github.com/monoceros-alpha/review-opyn-perp-vault-templates-2021-07/blob/d94fcb2e2173008272604705a9fc618710349462/code/contracts/core/OpynPerpVault.sol#L464-L471)
```solidity
    uint256 withdrawAmount = queuedShares.mul(roundTotalAsset[_round]).div(roundTotalShare[_round]);

    // remove user's queued shares
    userRoundQueuedWithdrawShares[msg.sender][_round] = 0;
    // decrease total asset we reserved for withdraw
    withdrawQueueAmount = withdrawQueueAmount.sub(withdrawAmount);

    emit WithdrawFromQueue(msg.sender, withdrawQueueAmount, _round);
```

**Recommendation**

Fix the code to reference `withdrawAmount` instead which represents the number of tokens the user deposited in the round.

### [`claimShares` should send tokens only if there something to transfer](https://github.com/monoceros-alpha/review-opyn-perp-vault-templates-2021-07/issues/5)
![Issue status: Open](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Status&message=Open&color=5856D6&style=flat-square) ![Medium](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Severity&message=Medium&color=FF9500&style=flat-square)

**Description**

A user can call `registerDeposit` when the vault is locked to add their own funds for the next investment round.

After enough time passes and the round is closed, by calling `closePositions`, the user can come back to the contract to retrieve their locked funds, along with the realized yields.

In order to do this, they need to call `claimShares`.

The method calculates how many tokens they should have received, in case they were to join when the vault was unlocked and transfers those tokens to the depositor.

The calculated value can be zero, either in case the depositor never added tokens, or the depositor already claimed their tokens. However, the transfer happens either way, for 0 tokens or for a positive value of tokens.


[code/contracts/core/OpynPerpVault.sol#L268-L271](https://github.com/monoceros-alpha/review-opyn-perp-vault-templates-2021-07/blob/518e4f6d174cae6ee75e316ad56789aaeb695069/code/contracts/core/OpynPerpVault.sol#L268-L271)
```solidity
    uint256 equivalentShares = amountDeposited.mul(roundTotalShare[_round]).div(roundTotalAsset[_round]);

    // transfer shares from vault to user
    _transfer(address(this), _depositor, equivalentShares);
```

**Recommendation**

It might help users (from a UX point of view) and the contract to only send tokens when there are tokens to send. Consider transferring only if there is a positive amount to be sent.

This will reduce the number of events the contract emits, and the user knows before committing the transaction if they will receive tokens or not.

### [Depositing should allow up to or equal to the cap](https://github.com/monoceros-alpha/review-opyn-perp-vault-templates-2021-07/issues/4)
![Issue status: Open](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Status&message=Open&color=5856D6&style=flat-square) ![Medium](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Severity&message=Medium&color=FF9500&style=flat-square)

**Description**

A user can deposit funds in the vault by calling `deposit()` or `registerDeposit()`.

When they are called, the total amount of locked funds are checked to be up to the specified limit, called the `cap`.


[code/contracts/core/OpynPerpVault.sol#L406](https://github.com/monoceros-alpha/review-opyn-perp-vault-templates-2021-07/blob/518e4f6d174cae6ee75e316ad56789aaeb695069/code/contracts/core/OpynPerpVault.sol#L406)
```solidity
    require(totalWithDepositedAmount < cap, "Cap exceeded");
```


[code/contracts/core/OpynPerpVault.sol#L248](https://github.com/monoceros-alpha/review-opyn-perp-vault-templates-2021-07/blob/518e4f6d174cae6ee75e316ad56789aaeb695069/code/contracts/core/OpynPerpVault.sol#L248)
```solidity
    require(totalWithDepositedAmount < cap, "Cap exceeded");
```

The check makes sure the amount of funds is strictly less than the limit. This will force the last user joining the vault to send an awkward amount of funds (similar to `99999999`). Allowing the total amount of funds to equal will make the user experience better, and also, the total reported amount of funds displayed will be easier to the eye.

**Recommendation**

Change the `require` to accept the sum of deposited amounts to be equal to the cap.

### [Prefer using `uint256` instead of a type with less than 256 bits](https://github.com/monoceros-alpha/review-opyn-perp-vault-templates-2021-07/issues/6)
![Issue status: Open](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Status&message=Open&color=5856D6&style=flat-square) ![Minor](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Severity&message=Minor&color=FFCC00&style=flat-square)

**Description**

The EVM works with 256bit/32byte words. For smaller data types, further operations are performed to downscale from 256 bits to the required lower bites type, and therefore having `uint8` as an iterator consumes more gas than keeping it to `uint256`.

There are several places where `uint8` is used as the type for the loop iterator:


[code/contracts/core/OpynPerpVault.sol#L420](https://github.com/monoceros-alpha/review-opyn-perp-vault-templates-2021-07/blob/3d44603300dd9abffe5a1c1e1c2647e9f6b80c7b/code/contracts/core/OpynPerpVault.sol#L420)
```solidity
    for (uint8 i = 0; i < actions.length; i = i + 1) {
```


[code/contracts/core/OpynPerpVault.sol#L441](https://github.com/monoceros-alpha/review-opyn-perp-vault-templates-2021-07/blob/3d44603300dd9abffe5a1c1e1c2647e9f6b80c7b/code/contracts/core/OpynPerpVault.sol#L441)
```solidity
    for (uint8 i = 0; i < actions.length; i = i + 1) {
```

**Recommendation**


The example below shows the difference between 2 variants of code, one using `uint8` and the other `uint256` for the iterators:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.6.12;

/**
 * Show the difference in gas costs between a loop that uses a uint8 variable
 * and one that uses uint256 variable.
 * 
 * Both contracts compiled with `Enable Optimization` set to 200 runs.
 */

contract LoopUint8 {
    
    address[] internal arr;

    // 1st call; arr.length == 0: gas cost 42719
    // 2nd call; arr.length == 1: gas cost 30322
    // 3rd call; arr.length == 2: gas cost 32925
    function add(address _new) public {
        for (uint8 i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
          if (arr[i] == _new) {
            require(false, 'exists');
          }
        }
        
        arr.push(_new);
    }
}


contract LoopUint256 {
    
    address[] internal arr;

    // 1st call; arr.length == 0: gas cost 42713
    // 2nd call; arr.length == 1: gas cost 30304
    // 3rd call; arr.length == 2: gas cost 32895
    function add(address _new) public {
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
          if (arr[i] == _new) {
            require(false, 'exists');
          }
        }
        
        arr.push(_new);
    }
}
```

**Recommendation**

Use `uint256` for the loop iterators.

### [Cache the length of actions when looping over them](https://github.com/monoceros-alpha/review-opyn-perp-vault-templates-2021-07/issues/3)
![Issue status: Open](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Status&message=Open&color=5856D6&style=flat-square) ![Minor](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Severity&message=Minor&color=FFCC00&style=flat-square)

**Description**

When the total reported amount of assets is estimated by the actions, the storage variable `actions.length` is used. This value does not change over time (in this loop) and can be cached in a local variable, instead of retrieving the value from the storage.


[code/contracts/core/OpynPerpVault.sol#L393-L395](https://github.com/monoceros-alpha/review-opyn-perp-vault-templates-2021-07/blob/518e4f6d174cae6ee75e316ad56789aaeb695069/code/contracts/core/OpynPerpVault.sol#L393-L395)
```solidity
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < actions.length; i++) {
      debt = debt.add(IAction(actions[i]).currentValue());
    }
```

Similarly for `_closeAndWithdraw()`:


[code/contracts/core/OpynPerpVault.sol#L420](https://github.com/monoceros-alpha/review-opyn-perp-vault-templates-2021-07/blob/3d44603300dd9abffe5a1c1e1c2647e9f6b80c7b/code/contracts/core/OpynPerpVault.sol#L420)
```solidity
    for (uint8 i = 0; i < actions.length; i = i + 1) {
```

**Recommendation**

Cache the length locally and use the local variable in the loop.

**Reference**

An example was created to illustrate the gas difference with or without length cache.

Not using a cache, for a set of 10 iterations uses **49157 gas**.

```solidity
contract SumNumbers {
    uint[] public numbers;
    
    constructor(uint size) {
        // Add some data to work with
        for (uint i = 0; i < size; i++) {
            numbers.push(i);
        }
    }
    
    function sumNumbers() public view returns (uint) {
        uint sum;
        for(uint i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
            sum += numbers[i];
        }
        
        return sum;
    }
}
```

Using a cache, for the same set of 10 iterations uses **48168 gas**.

```solidity
contract SumNumbersWithCache {
    uint[] public numbers;
    
    constructor(uint size) {
        // Add some data to work with
        for (uint i = 0; i < size; i++) {
            numbers.push(i);
        }
    }
    
    function sumNumbers() public view returns (uint) {
        uint sum;
        uint size = numbers.length;
        
        for(uint i = 0; i < size; i++) {
            sum += numbers[i];
        }
        
        return sum;
    }
}
```

Both contracts were compiled with 200 optimization rounds.

### [Improve gas costs by reducing the use of state variables when possible](https://github.com/monoceros-alpha/review-opyn-perp-vault-templates-2021-07/issues/2)
![Issue status: Open](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Status&message=Open&color=5856D6&style=flat-square) ![Minor](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Severity&message=Minor&color=FFCC00&style=flat-square)

**Description**

The owner can call `setCap` to set a new limit for the accepted funds.

After the cap was updated, an event is emitted.


[code/contracts/core/OpynPerpVault.sol#L200](https://github.com/monoceros-alpha/review-opyn-perp-vault-templates-2021-07/blob/518e4f6d174cae6ee75e316ad56789aaeb695069/code/contracts/core/OpynPerpVault.sol#L200)
```solidity
    emit CapUpdated(cap);
```

When the event is emitted, the storage variable is used. This forces an expensive `SLOAD` operation.

**Recommendation**

Use the argument received in the method when emitting the event instead of the storage variable.

### [OpynPerpVault.onlyLocked() documentation update](https://github.com/monoceros-alpha/review-opyn-perp-vault-templates-2021-07/issues/1)
![Issue status: Open](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Status&message=Open&color=5856D6&style=flat-square) ![Minor](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Severity&message=Minor&color=FFCC00&style=flat-square)

**Description**

The `LockState` modifier updates the `state` contract variable to `VaultState.Locked`:


[code/contracts/core/OpynPerpVault.sol#L116-L120](https://github.com/monoceros-alpha/review-opyn-perp-vault-templates-2021-07/blob/d94fcb2e2173008272604705a9fc618710349462/code/contracts/core/OpynPerpVault.sol#L116-L120)
```solidity
  /**
   * @dev can only be executed in the unlocked state. Sets the state to 'Locked'
   */
  modifier lockState {
    state = VaultState.Locked;
```

The issue is that the documentation above is confusing.

**Recommendation**

Reword the documentation text to read (_should_ instead of _can_):

> should only be executed in the unlocked state
